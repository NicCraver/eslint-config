## Components

Components in this dir will be auto-registered and on-demand, powered by [`unplugin-vue-components`](https://github.com/NicCraverunplugin-vue-components).


### Icons

You can use icons from almost any icon sets by the power of [Iconify](https://iconify.design/).

It will only bundle the icons you use. Check out [`unplugin-icons`](https://github.com/NicCraverunplugin-icons) for more details.
